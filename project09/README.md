<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Grand Central Dispatch is a Project 7 update to download/parse JSON data asynchronously with the user interface.

#### [Challenges]()
>1. Modify project 1 so that loading the list of NSSL images from our bundle happens in the background. Make sure you call reloadData() on the table view once loading has finished!
>2. Modify project 8 so that loading and parsing a level takes place in the background. Once you’re done, make sure you update the UI on the main thread!
>3. Modify project 7 so that your filtering code takes place in the background. This filtering code was added in one of the challenges for the project, so hopefully you didn’t skip it!
