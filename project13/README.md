<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Instafilter is an app that allows users to choose a photo from their album, change and apply filters, and save the processed image back to the photo album.

#### [Challenges](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/13/6/wrap-up)
>1. Try making the Save button show an error if there was no image in the image view.
>2. Make the Change Filter button change its title to show the name of the currently selected filter.
>3. Experiment with having more than one slider, to control each of the input keys you care about. For example, you might have one for radius and one for intensity.
