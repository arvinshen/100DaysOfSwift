<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Web Browser is an app that allows users to browse the web.

#### [Challenges](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/4/6/wrap-up)
>1. If users try to visit a URL that isn’t allowed, show an alert saying it’s blocked.
>2. Try making two new toolbar items with the titles Back and Forward. You should make them use webView.goBack and webView.goForward.
>3. For more of a challenge, try changing the initial view controller to a table view like in project 1, where users can choose their website from a list rather than just having the first in the array loaded up front.
