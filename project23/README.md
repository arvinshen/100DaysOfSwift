<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Swifty Ninja is a game app inspired by Fruit Ninja.

#### [Challenges](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/23/8/wrap-up)
>1. Try removing the magic numbers in the createEnemy() method. Instead, define them as constant properties of your class, giving them useful names.
>2. Create a new, fast-moving type of enemy that awards the player bonus points if they hit it.
>3. Add a “Game over” sprite node to the game scene when the player loses all their lives.
