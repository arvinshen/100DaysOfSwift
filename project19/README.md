<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

JavaScript Injection is a Safari extension which embeds a version of the app directly inside Safari's action menu, then manipulates Safari data. The extension is capable of reading the URL and page title of the website the user visited, then show a large text area they can type JavaScript into and when the extension is dismissed, it'll execute that JavaScript in Safari.

#### [Challenges](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/19/8/wrap-up)
>1. Add a bar button item that lets users select from a handful of prewritten example scripts, shown using a UIAlertController â€“ at the very least your list should include the example we used in this project.
>2. You're already receiving the URL of the site the user is on, so use UserDefaults to save the user's JavaScript for each site. You should convert the URL to a URL object in order to use its host property.
>3. For something bigger, let users name their scripts, then select one to load using a UITableView.
