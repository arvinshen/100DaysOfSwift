<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

JavaScript Injection is a Safari extension which embeds a version of the app directly inside Safari's action menu, then manipulates Safari data. The extension is capable of reading the URL and page title of the website the user visited, then show a large text area they can type JavaScript into and when the extension is dismissed, it'll execute that JavaScript in Safari.
