<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Exploding Monkeys is a game based on Gorillas (1991) which was released on an old text-based operating system, MS-DOS.

#### [Challenges](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/29/6/wrap-up)
>1. Add code and UI to track the player scores across levels, then make the game end after one player has won three times.
>2. Add Auto Layout rules for the UI components in our storyboard, allowing them to remain positioned neatly regardless of which iPad size is used.
>3. Use the physics worldâ€™s gravity to add random wind to each level, making sure to add a label telling players the direction and strength.
